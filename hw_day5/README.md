# The Day 5 Project
### This project is the result of homework of the fifth day lection. The program is the Express.js server with Handlebars.js templating library. It looks like a simple version of a social media (ex. Instagram). The application allows user to read posts, published by the other users, and also to write posts and share these posts with other users.
